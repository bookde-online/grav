By default, the default language code is prefixed to all URLs.

For example, if you support English and French (en and fr), and the default is English. A page route might look like /en/my-page for English and /fr/ma-page for French. However, it is often better to have the default language without a prefix, so you just set this option to false, and the English page will appear as /my-page.
