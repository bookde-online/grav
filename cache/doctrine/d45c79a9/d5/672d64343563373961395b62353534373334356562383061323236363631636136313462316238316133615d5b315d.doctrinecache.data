This allows for a site architecture that is easy to understand and implement as a set of nested folders. However, with a multilingual site, you may want to use a URL that makes more sense in that particular language.</p>
<p>Let's say we have the following folder structure:</p>
<p>01.animals
01.mammals
01.bats
02.bears
03.foxes
04.cats
02.reptiles
03.birds
04.insets
05.aquatic This would generate URLs like http://yoursite.com/animals/mammals/bears. This is great for an English site, but if you wanted to have a French version, you would want them translated appropriately. The easiest way to achieve this is to add a custom slug to each fr.mdpage file. For example, dynamic page
<img title="banner3" alt="banner3" src="/grav/images/c/0/2/0/0/c020014f97035a8818eee5d3ac0eed0db8085171-banner3.webp" /></p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
